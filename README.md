# SCCM-AD-Accounts-Used-by-ConfigMgr
We need to do more Planning in Configuration Manager 2012 and 2007 AD account allotment.

Recently, I was troubleshooting on cross forest client communication issues and it turned out to be account allocation issue. 
Iâ€™ll provide more details on this issue in next post.
